A regular Latin verb has 4 principal parts: Present active indicative, Infinitive, Perfect active indicative, and participle.

The first and third principal parts are finite verb forms. The first principal part uses the first person singular in the present active indicative, while the thrid principal part uses the first person singular in the perfect active indicative.

Interfeci is the same when prefixing inter- to a form of facio. Other than that, facio becomes interficio, facere becomes interficere, and factus becomes interfectus.

Two verbs belonging to the fourth conjugation include audire and venire.

The changes in capio and facio's principal parts are similar in that they follow the same spelling with the only exception being their root (capio using "cap" and facio using "fac") The principal parts of the verbs capio and facio share identical endings in the principal parts
