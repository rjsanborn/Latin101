**Cygnus, son of Mars, was killed (by Hercules) with a weapon. Mars came and fought with him (Hercules) on account of his son, but Jupiter sent lightning in between them.**

**Hesione was put next to a whale in Troy. Hercules killed the whale. Hercules killed Laomedon, father of Hesiones, with arrows.**
